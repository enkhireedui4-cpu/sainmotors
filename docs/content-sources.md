# Content sources and asset provenance

Reviewed 2026-10-17 by the web team (Enkh-Ireedui). Read-only access; no Drive file, folder or
sharing setting was changed. Drive links are kept here, never in page markup.

**Status rule.** Everything taken from the Drive sheets is *received from the brand teams*, not
*approved for publication*: it is `sourced` in `src/content/`. Web-team wording and translations are
`draft`. Only the content lead (Dashnyam) moves anything to `approved`.

## 1. Folders reviewed

| Folder (owner) | Drive ID | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| 212 team (m.monkhitgel) | `1Za5YjBNyjGyOcXiD2pwGmcjqjltFAtdC` | 212, CHERY RELY, FAW BESTUNE, FAW HONGQI, SAIC MAXUS; **Chery team folder is empty** |
| BYD team (tuguldur.esain) | `1salTROyzZM60McS5STiJCQAH0tn5LMOc` | Aito, BYD, Riddara |

Each brand folder holds one fact sheet (MN/EN columns: official name, short introduction,
distributor statement, official web link, sales phone, hero headline), a Logo folder and photos.

**Brand count.** Eleven: the ten on the company banner plus HONGQI, which has a complete sheet,
logo and distributor statement. HONGQI is the "eleventh brand" in the brief.

### Conflicts kept for the content lead (not silently resolved)

1. **RELY**: the brand file calls it "CHERY RELY", relaunched 2025 under Chery Group; an older sheet
   says "Rely" under Chery Commercial Vehicle with phone 7299 8855. The site follows the dedicated
   brand file (CHERY RELY, 7222 8855) and shows the brand as **RELY** in listings (its logo).
2. **BESTUNE**: two introductions (with/without "70-year FAW history"); site uses the dedicated file.
   Web link: faw.com (older sheet, certificate expired 2026-10-17) vs two Facebook pages (dedicated
   file). Site links FAWBestuneMongolia.
3. **MAXUS**: showroom (Darkhan) appears only in the 212 team's shared sheet, not in the MAXUS file.
4. **JETOUR phone**: 7010-8855 (jetour.mn contact data) vs 7277-8855 (jetour.mn news posts).
5. **Showroom-3 exterior** (garage doors, gravel yard) is labelled the JETOUR showroom since the
   jetour.mn build; confirm it is not the service centre.
6. **Dolgoon Nuur vs C1 TV building**: both are in Chingeltei; confirm they are separate showrooms.
7. **RIDDARA intro** says it is "the export name of Riddara" (probably Geely Radar): reworded to "a Geely
   Holding brand"; please confirm the intended wording.
8. **RIDDARA statement** calls it a "luxury electric" brand (same words as the AITO statement); left out as a
   likely copy-over. The site keeps the distributor fact and year only.
9. **CHERY Saturday hours**: the CHERY site's contact page and footer say 09:00–19:00, its dealer page
   09:00–21:00. The site follows the two that agree.
10. **Shared sales lines**: 7299 8855 is given for both BESTUNE (Sansar) and MAXUS (Darkhan), and 7222 8855
   for both 212 and RELY (Dolgoon Nuur). Both match their sheets; confirm they are intended.

### Brand channels (2026-10-20)

Each brand links only to its Mongolian channel run by Sain Motors: its Facebook page, plus jetour.mn for
JETOUR. International manufacturer sites are no longer linked (user's instruction, 2026-10-20). Pages
were identified by name through Facebook's public page plugin (`/plugins/page.php?href=…`), since
facebook.com refuses anonymous requests.

| Brand | Channel | Page name / evidence |
|---|---|---|
| JETOUR | jetour.mn; facebook.com/profile.php?id=100093386917379 | "Jetour Mongolia - Sain Motors", 19K followers (a namesake page, id 100094097087099, has 110 and is not used) |
| CHERY | facebook.com/CheryMongolia | "Chery Mongolia - Sain Motors"; chery.mn still hidden (no DNS) |
| BYD | facebook.com/profile.php?id=61579315933755 | "BYD Mongolia - Sain Motors Authorized Distributor": the hyperlink behind the BYD sheet's web-link cell. facebook.com/bydmongolia belongs to another distributor |
| MAXUS | facebook.com/profile.php?id=61572688311986 | "SAIC Maxus Mongolia - Sain Motors": the MAXUS sheet's "Facebook" hyperlink |

| RELY | facebook.com/chery.rely.mongolia.sainmotors | "Chery Rely Mongolia - Sain Motors" |
| BESTUNE | facebook.com/BestuneSainmotors | "Bestune Mongolia - Sain Motors", 18K followers, the dedicated sheet's hyperlink; replaces FAWBestuneMongolia ("FAW Bestune Mongolia - Sain Motors") |
| HONGQI | facebook.com/HongqiMongolia1 | "Hongqi Mongolia - Sain motors" (the sheet's hyperlink points at the 212 page; its text is right) |
| RIDDARA | none yet | "Riddara Mongolia - Sain Motors" is named in ikon.mn articles; address not found. The RIDDARA and AITO sheets carry BYD's hyperlink |
| AITO, SOUEAST | none yet | No Sain Motors page found |

Masters in `assets/photos/brands/` are WebP q90 at ≤4096 px from these originals; derivatives are
built by `npm run images`. Local team copies are now the active sources; BYD's coast,
top/left and TI 7 images are also included in its model gallery.

### Earlier image review (superseded by the user's source confirmation on 2026-10-18)

The following were previously held back while sourcing manufacturer alternatives. The user has
now explicitly identified Desktop `brands6` and `3brand` as the official supplied material and
instructed us to use their images. They are used as supplied brand artwork, without claims about
photographic capture, added specifications, or inferred model names. The source files are untouched.
See [brand-material-inventory.json](brand-material-inventory.json).

| File (Drive ID) | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Riddara RD6 `1kvKp9xm…` | PNG text chunk `hf-job-id` (Higgsfield); reflection does not match the car |
| BYD TI 7 `hf_20261016_…png` `1oIp2NXv…` | Higgsfield file name; garbled text beside the headlamp |
| hongqi.png `105AtbwdbbcL…` | plate reads "HONGOI HS5" |
| rely.png, Bestune.png, Maxus.png | same 2752×1536 generator size as hongqi.png, no camera metadata, placard-style model plates |

The eight supplied brands now use the local team images on the homepage and their brand pages.
SOUEAST retains its manufacturer illustration (S09), since it is in neither supplied folder; CHERY's homepage card uses
the blue TIGGO 7 PRO MAX image supplied by the user as Desktop `37620.png` on 2026-10-18.
Its full vehicle is preserved in a 1.6-ratio crop. Details are in [homepage-card-assets.md](homepage-card-assets.md).

### Sain Motors web photo set (Desktop `sainmotorsWebPhotos`, supplied 2026-10-20)

The company's own folder "WEB Photos": folders 1 (home company hero), 2 (home services hero) and
6 (services), plus loose files, logos (8) and the brand guideline (9). Canon EOS R5 II and Sony ILCE-7RM2
photographs, drone frames saved as screenshots, and Facebook exports. All are real photographs (camera EXIF
or recognisable video frames); none shows generator traces. Masters: `assets/photos/site/*.webp` (q90, ≤4096 px);
sources untouched. Alt text describes only what is visible; no location is claimed where the frame does not show it.

Not used: the two participation-certificate scans (708155250…, 708155742…) show individuals' names; the
`SAIN | BYD` group banner (708919196…) is a designed graphic. Folder 2 repeats most of folder 1.

### MEGA TEST DRIVE film and events (2026-10-20)

- **Film:** Desktop `SnapSave_App_1366867448896240_1080p.mp4` (supplied by the user; Facebook video
  1366867448896240; 86.6 s, 1920×1080, 25 fps). The burned-in title reads "MEGA Event TEST DRIVE 7 —
  OFF-ROAD EDITION", so it is the seventh edition, not the eighth. Derivatives in `public/video/`:
  `mtd7-teaser.mp4` (muted 15 s loop of 0:54–0:59.5, 0:22–0:25, 0:32–0:35, 1:02.5–1:06; 1280 px, 2.1 MB)
  and `mtd7-full.mp4` (the whole film, 1280 px, AAC, 17 MB). Posters: frames at 0:54 (`mtd7-river-crossing`)
  and 0:24 (`mtd7-212-mud`, built, not placed).
- **Editions** (`src/content/events.ts`, all `sourced`), from the registration sites in
  github.com/Enhireedui/mega-test-drive (README at the commit given) and ikon.mn (2026-06-23):

| Edition | Days | Venue | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 2026-10-09 – 10-10, 10:00–19:00 | Darkhan | README @b7c5045; first announced for 10-01 – 10-02 (@b7a09a0) |
| 7, off-road | 2026-08-22, 11:00–19:00 | Морингийн даваа (Наадамчдын зам); coaches from the BYD 4S showroom | README @31cbce4 |
| 6 | 2026-08-08 – 08-09 | Within the Шилийн Богд Moto Festival; Sain Motors general sponsor | README @c476715 |
| 5 | 2026-08-01 | not stated | README @5868efc (not listed on the site) |
| 3 | 2026-06-27 | BYD 4S showroom yard, Tsambagarav | ikon.mn/n/3ogh (not listed on the site) |

These are the dates the registration sites published, i.e. as planned. Edition 7 is confirmed held by
its film; please confirm 6 and 8 took place as listed. "8 editions" is read from the numbering.
No edition has a registration link: all are over (`src/lib/events.ts`, Asia/Ulaanbaatar).

## 4. Logos

| Brand | File used | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 212, RELY, BESTUNE, HONGQI, MAXUS | `* black.png` (as supplied) | Drive Logo folders |
| BYD, RIDDARA | variant 2 (black) / variant 1 wordmark of the supplied SVG sheet | Drive Logo folders |
| JETOUR, CHERY | banner-derived files | company brand banner, 2026-10-15 |
| AITO | black/white wordmark band from its SVG sheet | Desktop `3brand/Aito/Logo/AITO_logo 1.svg` |
| SOUEAST | Official white wordmark for homepage cards; light-background version still pending | SOUEAST global S09 header |

Dark-context marks use the supplied white variants. Five PNG pairs were copied from Desktop
`brands6`; BYD, RIDDARA and AITO are extracted from Desktop `3brand` presentation sheets with
their background panels excluded. Original geometry and colours are preserved.

## 5. Still needed

- Written publication approval for everything above (status → `approved`).
- SOUEAST: light-background logo, local introduction, showroom, contact.
- CHERY: approval of the introduction and showroom details. The homepage card uses the user-supplied
  TIGGO 7 PRO MAX image (`37620.png`); the dedicated brand page uses the separately supplied
  TIGGO 7 PRO MAX road photograph (`37628.png`). Both originals are preserved; the prior TIGGO 8 source is archived.
- A valid TLS certificate for sainmotors.mn (it serves an expired `*.webhost.mn` certificate; checked 2026-10-18).
- Whether marketing2@esain.mn is the intended public address, or a general one such as info@.
- Service-centre photographs: supplied 2026-10-20 (above). Confirm which site the workshop frames show
  before captions name a place.
- MEGA TEST DRIVE: confirm editions 6 and 8 as held; photographs or a film of other editions, if wanted on the site.
- Opening hours and map pins for the Dolgoon Nuur, Sansar, BYD 4S and Darkhan showrooms.
- English review of web-team translations of the distributor statements (`draft`).
